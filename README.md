# Cryptocurrency Tracking Web App

Welcome to the Cryptocurrency Tracking Web App repository! I developed this project to apply the concepts I've learned so far in the web development bootcamp course I'm currently undertaking. The goal of this project is to create a web application that allows users to track various cryptocurrencies by searching for specific pairs and displaying relevant information about them.

## Concepts Covered

-   **Asynchronous Programming**
-   **Manipulating the DOM**
-   **Events/Event Listeners**
-   **Forms**
-   **APIs (CoinGecko API)**
-   **JavaScript Objects**

## How to Use

1.  **Search for a Cryptocurrency Pairing**: Enter the cryptocurrency symbol and currency pairing you want to track in the provided search form.
2.  **View Information**: Upon submitting the form, the web app fetches data from the CoinGecko API and dynamically adds a tile displaying information about the requested cryptocurrency pair to the list.
